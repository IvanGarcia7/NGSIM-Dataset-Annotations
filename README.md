Three video sequences from US Highway 101 Dataset have been used. These videos has been captured by highway video surveillance systems from high perspective and belong to the U.S. Department of Transportation. These systems collect a series of sequences with a large number of small vehicles. 
The sequences have a total duration of about 15 minutes. See the following link to get more information:

From the beginning of each video sequence, 1 minute has been manually annotated (476 manually labeled images with a total of 14557 vehicles) in order to evaluate our proposal by obtaining the Mean Average Precision (mAP) once the fine tuning has been applied.
