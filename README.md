# Manually annotated video sequences

These video sequences have been annotated in order to carry out the evaluation phase of the proposal presented in the following link:

Three video sequences from US Highway 101 Dataset:

* https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/operations/07030/index.cfm 

have been used. These videos has been captured by highway video surveillance systems from high perspective and belong to the U.S. Department of Transportation. These systems collect a series of sequences with a large number of small vehicles. The sequences have a total duration of about 15 minutes. 

From the beginning of each video sequence, 1 minute has been manually annotated (476 manually labeled images with a total of 14557 vehicles) in order to evaluate our proposal by obtaining the Mean Average Precision (mAP) once the fine tuning has been applied. 

# Content:

For each of the video sequences, the set of frames that made up the video have been labeled, including these images in the following links:

* https://github.com/IvanGarcia7/NGSIM-Dataset-Annotations/tree/main/Sequence1/images
* https://github.com/IvanGarcia7/NGSIM-Dataset-Annotations/tree/main/Sequence2/images
* https://github.com/IvanGarcia7/NGSIM-Dataset-Annotations/tree/main/Sequence3/images

Additionally, the JSON in COCO format has been included to carry out the tests.
